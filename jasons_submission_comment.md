Please see the attachment, containing a collaboratively developed response that
I led. Community updates to that response will be maintained at this URL: https://github.com/JasonJWilliamsNY/2018_nih_datascience_rfi. These
to-the-point comments are complied in realization that NIH has a major influence
over the direction of biomedical data science, and with sincere trust that NIH
is committed to highest standards of academic rigor, commitment to its own
mission, and responsibility to the US Tax Payer. Although every effort has been
made for this response to consist only of productive and objective criticisms,
I will express a personal and subjective comment here that my current and past
dealings with NIH personnel have demonstrated them to be passionately committed
to the same high standards aforementioned. Every person and every organization
that aspires to be more than it is, will reach a point where its own resources
cannot take them in the direction they need to go. I hope that NIH will consider
leveraging the entire, diverse, biomedical data science community to achieve its
greatest success in leveraging data science for the betterment of human health;
it *will* take all of us.
