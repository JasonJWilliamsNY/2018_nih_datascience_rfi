# Goal 5: "Enact Appropriate Policies to Promote Stewardship and Sustainability"



##  The appropriateness of the goals of the plan and of the strategies and implementation tactics proposed to achieve them

Goal 5: Here, and once in goal 3 are the only mentions in the document of a community-driven activity (which actually needs to be brought to the entire SPDS). The FAIR Data Ecosystem is a laudable goal, but the idea that NIH should “Strive to ensure that all data in NIH-supported data resources are FAIR” is still a goal without a plan. More than technological advances or implementation, this is a training activity that requires community awareness, understanding, input, and buy-in on FAIR principles. The implementation tactics are plausible, but ultimately without appropriate evaluation are too vague to establish success. Establishing open-source licenses or even promoting their use won’t in itself FAIR. This section misses out on how the hard question of ELSI/privacy and biomedical data which NIH currently has not updated to accommodate the vision of what biomedical data science might achieve.  

Goal 5: Evaluation is inappropriate/unrevealing count metrics that will not indicate whether or not FAIR principles are realized. 


## Opportunities for NIH to partner in achieving these goals



##  Additional concepts that should be included in the plan



## Performance measures and milestones that could be used to gauge the success of elements of the plan and inform course corrections



## Any other topic the respondent feels is relevant for NIH to consider in developing this strategic plan
