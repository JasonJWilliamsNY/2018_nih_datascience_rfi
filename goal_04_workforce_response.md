# Goal 4: "Enhance Workforce Development for Biomedical Data Science"



##  The appropriateness of the goals of the plan and of the strategies and implementation tactics proposed to achieve them



## Opportunities for NIH to partner in achieving these goals



##  Additional concepts that should be included in the plan
***Citizen Science* as more than "individuals giving their brains for analyzing data using computer games".** There are growing communities of patients and healthy individuals who are coming together to analyse biomedical data, either their own or using public data resources to perform science under their own lead (c.f. http://jme.bmj.com/content/early/2015/03/30/medethics-2015-102663 on participant-lead research). These community efforts are growing substantially and are bound to be come important stakeholders in performing additional biomedical research. The needs of these communities should thus be targeted to.


## Performance measures and milestones that could be used to gauge the success of elements of the plan and inform course corrections



## Any other topic the respondent feels is relevant for NIH to consider in developing this strategic plan
