# Goal 4: "Enhance Workforce Development for Biomedical Data Science"



##  The appropriateness of the goals of the plan and of the strategies and implementation tactics proposed to achieve them

Regarding Goal 4; Workforce Development, Feldon et.al (PNAS, 2017; https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1705783114) concludes that despite $28 million in
investment by NSF and NIH in training (including workshops/boot camps relevant
to biomedical data science), much of this training is “not associated with
observable benefits related to skill development, scholarly productivity, or
socialization into the academic community.” Clearly, if NIH intends to do better
it needs to completely reconceive how it approaches training in data science.

Goal 4 correctly identifies several reasonable priorities, but proposes
demonstrably ineffective and/or inappropriate approaches and evaluation metrics
to achieve these goals.

The inadequacy of the Goal 4 strategy is epitomized by its proposed evaluation
metric: “the quantity of new data science-related training programs for NIH
staff and participation in these programs.” This is as unconvincing as
suggesting a research proposal will be measured in the number of experiments
performed. In fact, the only metric proposed for evaluation of training is the
number of training opportunities created. Such an arbitrary and crude metric
would get any research proposal returned from study section without discussion.
Number of training opportunities cannot be a plausible metric. Despite their
being no shortage of training opportunities from MOOCs to workshops, there is a
persistent, apparent, and urgent training gap. This inadequate metric is a clear
red flag that training guided by the proposed plan will accomplish very little.

It is clear that training (Goal 4) is under-prioritized by NIH. In the largest
survey on unmet needs for life science investigators, NSF investigators report
in Barone et.al (PLOS Comp. Bio, 2017; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005755)
that their most unmet computational needs are not software, infrastructure or
compute. Instead it is the need for training; specifically training in
integration of multiple data types, data and metadata management, and scaling
analyses to HPC and cloud.

Goal 4 fails to properly account for the role of training in biomedical data
science and the need to define and measure what constitutes effective training.
There is no mention made of a serious commitment to evidence-based teaching that
is needed to design effective short-format courses and workshops. While the
educational pipeline from at least the undergraduate level and beyond needs
serious improvement to address biomedical data science, short-format training
and workshops will play an important role. These workshops must not be
constructed ad hoc. Typically, training is delivered by staff/faculty with a
high level of bioinformatics/data science domain expertise, but little to no
guidance in andragogy, cognitive science, or evaluation.

## Opportunities for NIH to partner in achieving these goals

We present comments here in the hopes that NIH will consider bold action in this
area because the problem is solvable and the community of investigators with
experience in training relevant to biomedical data science has been thinking
deeply on the topic. The community is relatively small, well connected, and
should be extensively leveraged in developing robust scalable solutions. It
should be easy to assemble the 10-20 most important practitioners and educators
in biomedical data science, confident that they and their second order
collaborators would constitute a reasonably sized working group that can bring
in much needed solutions. Understandably, in fact by definition as an
aspirational goal, NIH has identified the value in prioritizing data science
as an area it needs to be at the forefront of but does not have the expertise
to achieve alone. The community does.

Right now, the single best target for collaboration is the Software and Data
Carpentry community (Greg Wilson: "Software Carpentry: Lessons Learned".
F1000Research,2016, 3:62 (doi: 10.12688/f1000research.3-62.v2). There are many
reasons why collaboration here will be tremendously important for NIH to
succeed. First, the Carpentry community itself represents a global federation
of researchers in the space of computation, data science, bioinformatics, and
related fields with a strong interest in education. In short – this is a
self-selected community of hundreds to thousands of researchers; the available
expertise in biomedical data science is well-covered in this community.
Additionally, there simply is no other community that has built a sustainable
and scalable approach to building educational content relevant to biomedical
data science with strong grounding in assessment and pedagogy. It would be
a tremendous squandering of resources to not build on this foundation.

Additionally, this is an area that especially calls for collaboration with the
National Science Foundation. NSF already has several strong funded programs that
are dedicated to understanding the problems of bioinformatics education and
biomedical data science and developing solutions – the Network for Integrating
Bioinformatics Education into Life Science
(NIBLSE, https://qubeshub.org/groups/niblse) is just one of many. NIBLSE has
for example, identified that the newest trained faculty with bioinformatics
expertise are not bringing that training into the classroom, and the lack of
training is the biggest barrier to bioinformatics education
(https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2017/10/19/204420). The potential for
synergy here is enormous for developing the k-16 pipeline. This alliance
(especially leveraging NSF INCLUDES) could be a tremendous opportunity to do so
in a way that enhances diversity. And while there are distinct career paths for
biomedical vs. non-human life sciences, there is almost complete overlap in the
study, preparation, and training for both student groups.

##  Additional concepts that should be included in the plan

There are a few basic concepts that must be included; and these are (I think)
at the right level for a strategic vision document.

- Training is the most unmet need of investigators. Investments that
  under-prioritize training will not realize the value of computational and data
  infrastructure developed.

- Biomedical data science education must not be solely delivered by domain
  experts/investigators training according to what they think is best.
  Curriculum must be developed using evidence-based pedagogical principles.
- Collaboration is key. Training that is developed as the unitary creation of
  NIH will fail. Training must be developed by a community that can maintain and
  sustain learning content.
- Assessment is an integral part of training and cannot be ad hoc, it must
  generate evidence that learning has occurred, and be developed in a framework
  community of practice. This is hard – it is easy to count the number of CPU
  cycles paid for on the cloud, or the size of a database.
- Data science must not about science, and not just data. It is easy to
  accumulate datasets, but not easy to develop training that is measurably
  effective – however it is definitely possible.
- Citizen Science is more than "individuals giving their brains for analyzing
  data using computer games". There are growing communities of patients and
  healthy individuals who are coming together to analyze biomedical data, either
  their own or using public data resources to perform science under their own
  lead (c.f. http://jme.bmj.com/content/early/2015/03/30/medethics-2015-102663
  on participant-lead research). These community efforts are growing
  substantially and are bound to become important stakeholders in performing
  additional biomedical research. The needs of these communities should thus be
  targeted to.
- Diversity is a highly obtainable goal for biomedical data science education.

## Performance measures and milestones that could be used to gauge the success of elements of the plan and inform course corrections

This question is difficult to answer because there needs to be a defined and
agreed-upon set of competencies for biomedical data science. From these will
follow learning objectives and assessments for these objectives. At the next
stage will be dissemination targets and measures of community use and buy in.
A workshop could resolve and develop these over the course of a few months.

## Any other topic the respondent feels is relevant for NIH to consider in developing this strategic plan

The work being done by NSF as well as the Data Science recommendations developed
by the National Academies are highly relevant and need to be better integrated.
There is also a unique connection in Data Science to industry. Industry partners
will continue to lead advances in Data Science relevant to biomedicine.
