# 2018_nih_datascience_rfi
This is a short response to the 2018 RFI on NIH Strategic Plan for Data Science

# Purpose
On March 5th, 2018 [this post](https://nexus.od.nih.gov/all/2018/03/05/requesting-your-input-on-the-draft-nih-strategic-plan-for-data-science/) announced a request for information (RFI) on the
NIH [Strategic Plan for Data Science](https://grants.nih.gov/grants/rfi/NIH-Strategic-Plan-for-Data-Science.pdf).
Responses are due April 2nd, 2018 on [this form](https://grants.nih.gov/grants/rfi/rfi.cfm?ID=73).

**This repo contains language that you can use in your response to this RFI**

## How to use these comments


Importantly, (and related to the writing tip below) we need every member of the
community to create a lot of noise. Your comment is your vote. Review the arguments/points in these comments and use them to submit at [this form](https://grants.nih.gov/grants/rfi/rfi.cfm?ID=73). If NIH sees enough of
the same comments from enough people the message will get across.
Get your colleagues involved too! Feel free to say things in your own words, or
pull directly from language used here. Only submit comments that represent your
views; see [guide notice instructions](https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/notice-files/NOT-OD-18-134.html)


## How to contribute

At least a few folks have expressed interest in collaborating on a response.
Hopefully this results in NIH getting the same messages multiple times. Hope
folks chime in on how to make that happen, but in my (Jason) opinion we have to
keep our message short and to the point ... this is a strategic plan so nuanced
comments will just get deflected.

Repo is organized so that your comments on a specific goal can be captured
according to the headings on the NIH feedback form.

Please submit a pull request, or (and especially if you aren't familiar with
Github) please click the issues tab to open an issue, or Tweet/email me (email =
my last name @ cshl.edu).

### Writing tip

Be clear - a RFI is not the place for subtlety. While I can’t speak on behalf
of NIH, what happens is that comments are classified as good/positive or
bad/negative and summed up. That’s it. Your carefully crafted arguments won’t
mean much if NIH does not receive a clear message that “Goal 1”, or
"Objective 4-3" got 50 positive comments and 3 negative comments. Hopefully
someone comes back to appreciate the cleverness of your prose, but make sure
your comment is to-the-point.


## Contributors
Besides the enormous sense of pride your contribution will no doubt create,
please add your name here in case anyone from NIH looks (I'll add a link to this
repo in the response in case it continues to grow). This will be more obvious
than looking through commit histories, and I will only put any names here if
you tell me you want acknowledgement - some may wish to be somewhat anonymous.
