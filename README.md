# 2018_nih_datascience_rfi
This is a short response to the 2018 RFI on NIH Strategic Plan for Data Science

# Purpose
On March 5th, 2018 [this post](https://nexus.od.nih.gov/all/2018/03/05/requesting-your-input-on-the-draft-nih-strategic-plan-for-data-science/) announced a request for information (RFI) on the
NIH [Strategic Plan for Data Science](https://grants.nih.gov/grants/rfi/NIH-Strategic-Plan-for-Data-Science.pdf).
Responses are due April 2nd, 2018 on [this form](https://grants.nih.gov/grants/rfi/rfi.cfm?ID=73).

## How to contribute

At least a few folks have expressed interest in collaborating on a response.
Hopefully this results in NIH getting the same messages multiple times. Hope
folks chime in on how to make that happen, but in my (Jason) opinion we have to
keep our message short and to the point ... this is a strategic plan so nuanced
comments will just get deflected.

Repo is organized so that your comments on a specific goal can be captured
according to the headings on the NIH feedback form.

Please submit a pull request, or (and especially if you aren't familiar with
Github) please click the issues tab to open an issue, or Tweet/email me (email =
my last name @ cshl.edu).



## Contributors
Besides the enormous sense of pride your contribution will no doubt create,
please add your name here in case anyone from NIH looks (I'll add a link to this
repo in the response in case it continues to grow). This will be more obvious
than looking through commit histories, and I will only put any names here if
you tell me you want acknowledgement - some may wish to be somewhat anonymous.
