This is a short response to the 2018 RFI on NIH Strategic Plan for Data Science

# Purpose
On March 5th, 2018 [this post](https://nexus.od.nih.gov/all/2018/03/05/requesting-your-input-on-the-draft-nih-strategic-plan-for-data-science/) announced a request for information (RFI) on the
NIH [Strategic Plan for Data Science](https://grants.nih.gov/grants/rfi/NIH-Strategic-Plan-for-Data-Science.pdf).
Responses are due April 2nd, 2018 on [this form](https://grants.nih.gov/grants/rfi/rfi.cfm?ID=73).

**This repo contains language that you can use in your response to this RFI**

## How to use these comments

**A [Similar RFI](https://nlmdirector.nlm.nih.gov/2018/03/20/next-generation-data-science-research-challenges/) only generated 53 responses. Your voice will be heard!**

1. If possible, read the entire [Strategic Plan](https://grants.nih.gov/grants/rfi/NIH-Strategic-Plan-for-Data-Science.pdf).
If you don't have that much time, read one of the Goal sections most relevant to
you (individual sections are as short as 10 minutes of reading).

2. We have created a preamble and specific responses to each goal in our
[collected responses](./combined_response.md). You may copy and paste all/some/none
of what you agree with using the online NIH form (step 3). You may modify
anything you find here, or write your own response (**Please consider submitting
your own responses here for the community to use, or review even after the
RFI due date**).

> **Tip**: The NIH form only has 5 text submission fields. Copy the preamble into
> the first field, along with your comments on the "appropriateness of goals."
> All other subheadings in our combined response doc match the submission form
> headings.

3. By **April 2, 2018 11:59:59 PM EDT** access the NIH [online form](https://grants.nih.gov/grants/rfi/rfi.cfm?ID=73), write in and/or
copy-paste your responses. Please follow all of the form instructions/guidelines,
Invalid responses (e.g. automated, or in some other way disqualified) will not
be accepted. Only submit comments that represent your
