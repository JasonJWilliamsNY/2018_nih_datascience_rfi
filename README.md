# 2018_nih_datascience_rfi
This is a short response to the 2018 RFI on NIH Strategic Plan for Data Science

# Purpose
On March 5th, 2018 [this post](https://nexus.od.nih.gov/all/2018/03/05/requesting-your-input-on-the-draft-nih-strategic-plan-for-data-science/) announced a request for information (RFI) on the
NIH [Strategic Plan for Data Science](https://grants.nih.gov/grants/rfi/NIH-Strategic-Plan-for-Data-Science.pdf).
Responses are due April 2nd, 2018 on [this form](https://grants.nih.gov/grants/rfi/rfi.cfm?ID=73).

## How to contribute
My personal [response](./response.md) is open for contribution. Mostly I am
interested in 1) getting input on ideas I've missed, 2) corrections, 3) spurring
others to comment themselves - freely lifting any language or citations they
agree with from my text. Please have at it, but let's try to keep it short.
Please submit a pull request, or (and especially if you aren't familiar with
Github) please click the issues tab to open an issue, or Tweet/email me (email =
my last name @ cshl.edu).

## Contributors
Besides the enormous sense of pride your contribution will no doubt create,
please add your name here in case anyone from NIH looks (I'll add a link to this
repo in the response in case it continues to grow). This will be more obvious
than looking through commit histories, and I will only put any names here if
you tell me you want acknowledgement - some may wish to be somewhat anonymous.
